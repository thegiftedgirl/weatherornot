Weather Or Not
Ever wake up in the morning with nothing to do, but the urge to seize the day? Well Weather Or Not is an app that not only tells you the local weather, it also suggests what to wear.
An app using a weather api allowing users to check on the weather whilst simultaneously helping the user decide what may be appropriate to wear and what to do (eventbrite api) according to the their location and the daily weather expectations.


AAU should be able to signup, login and create user profile.
AAU should be able to get information on location weather for day. 
AAU should be able to see images/text suggestions on what to wear or not to wear.
